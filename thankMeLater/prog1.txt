discussion:
The Employee class has three constructors:

-The first constructor initializes an employee with a specified name and default values for ID, salary, and designation.
-The second constructor allows specifying the name, salary, and designation.
-The third constructor creates a temporary employee with default values.
Now let's discuss the pr1 class:
In the main method of the pr1 class:

-An array employees of type Employee is created with a size of 3.
-Three instances of the Employee class are created using different constructors.
-A for-each loop is used to iterate through the employees array and print the details of each employee.
The output of this program will display the information of three employees, including the default values for those not explicitly provided. The commented-out code below the for-each loop is an alternative way to achieve the same output using a traditional for loop.
